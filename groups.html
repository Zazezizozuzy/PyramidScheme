                <strong>The Crimson Monastery</strong>
                <hr >
                A divinity school that was teleported into the realm far their home plane. The disciples of the temple seemed to have littler concern for this. As their beliefs focus on the power of the individual over the divine powers of greater gods. Transporting to a new world only extends the reach of their teachings and those that they can aid.

                <strong>Children of the Forge</strong>
                <hr >
                The stone dwarves of a forgotten kingdom. Long under siege by soulless contructs, unearthed from beneath the realm. The dwarves defended their city and the great forge it held. One day, the mountain it stood below, visible from afar by its tooth baring peak, collapsed. Travellers have told stories of the great vines that sprung from the glacial tops reaching up into the clouds. These stalks fell too with the mountain. Now little to no sign remains of the city and roads that met it. Each overgrown train ends in abrupt rocky canyons. Everything beyond lies in the silence of stone.

                <strong>The Heralds of Dust: Dustmen, Dusties</strong>
                <hr >
                Dwellers of the Mortuary of Sigil and embracers of death. Record keepers for the once living and employers of the undead. The Dustmen believe that this life serves little purpose until its end. One must continue through the suffering to reach the ultimate goal. By removing all passion and obstaining from resurrection, they bring themselves closer to the True Death. Only on reaching True Death can you shed the burden of life and find true meaning in the multiverse.
