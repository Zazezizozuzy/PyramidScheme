                <strong>Sigil, The City of Doors</strong>
                <hr >
                At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the Spire. A needle shaped mountain that rises infinitely into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow peak floats the torus-shaped city of Sigil. Its myriad of structures, cascading over themselves, built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures standing on one of Sigil's streats can see the city curve up over their heads. Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.

                <strong>Wilderness of the Beastlands</strong>
                <hr >
                A plane of nature unbound, of forests ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The plane embodies the wild's havoc and beauty. Speaking to the animal within all living things and wandered by the very law of nature herself.
