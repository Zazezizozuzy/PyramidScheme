        <h1>PYRAMID SCHEME</h1>

        <hr >
        <p>Park your ears and let me tell a tale of a few berks who went on a ride to save a sheep. Got themselves caught up in a kip of a pyramid. Travelled a world away to meet some stone folks held in a birdcage by soulless bashers and dark scales. Then, they hit a gate and wandered into the Outer Planes.
