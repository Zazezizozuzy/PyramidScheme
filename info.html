                                A tomb atop outlandish spire,<br>
                                As birds of prey on branch of ire.<br>

                                Great as moon and wide as wood.<br>
                                The rabbits quite forgot themselves,<br>
                                And frozen there like saplings stood.<br>

                                The Farmer bargained for some bread,<br>
